# Config file for pulledpork
# Be sure to read through the entire configuration file
# If you specify any of these items on the command line, it WILL take 
# precedence over any value that you specify in this file!

#######  The below section defines what your oinkcode is (required for 
#######  VRT rules), defines a temp path (must be writable) and also 
#######  defines what version of rules that you are getting (for your 
#######  snort version and subscription etc...)
####### 

# You can specify one or as many rule_urls as you like, they 
# must appear as http://what.site.com/|rulesfile.tar.gz|1234567.  You can specify
# each on an individual line, or you can specify them in a , separated list
# i.e. rule_url=http://x.y.z/|a.tar.gz|123,http://z.y.z/|b.tar.gz|456
# note that the url, rule file, and oinkcode itself are separated by a pipe |
# i.e. url|tarball|123456789, 
# rule_url=https://www.snort.org/reg-rules/|snortrules-snapshot.tar.gz|<oinkcode>
# NEW Community ruleset:
rule_url=https://snort.org/downloads/community/|community-rules.tar.gz|Community
# NEW For IP Blacklisting! Note the format is urltofile|IPBLACKLIST|<oinkcode>
# This format MUST be followed to let pulledpork know that this is a blacklist
rule_url=http://talosintelligence.com/feeds/ip-filter.blf|IPBLACKLIST|open
# URL for rule documentation! (slow to process)
# rule_url=https://www.snort.org/reg-rules/|opensource.gz|<oinkcode>
# THE FOLLOWING URL is for emergingthreats downloads, note the tarball name change!
# and open-nogpl, to avoid conflicts.
rule_url=https://rules.emergingthreats.net/|emerging.rules.tar.gz|open-nogpl
# THE FOLLOWING URL is for etpro downloads, note the tarball name change!
# and the et oinkcode requirement!
#rule_url=https://rules.emergingthreatspro.com/|etpro.rules.tar.gz|<et oinkcode>
# NOTE above that the VRT snortrules-snapshot does not contain the version
# portion of the tarball name, this is because PP now automatically populates
# this value for you, if, however you put the version information in, PP will
# NOT populate this value but will use your value!
